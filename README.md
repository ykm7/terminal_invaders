## Terminal based space invaders.

Built with C for practice with the Ncurses library.

### Build
Requires the Ncurses library to build.
"cmake ." in root directory.
'make'

Game will be built in the build directory.

#### TODO:
Incorporate colours.
Build more tests.

#### TOFIX:
If possible, remove the delay when holding a key down. However from what I understand it is out of ncurses scope.
